Special thanks to Google and the CSSI team for giving us this amazing opportunity. We could not have done it without you.
Shoutout to Cohort-25 and all of our Googlers: Logan, Thomas, Mark, Lauren, Andy, Dean.
Thank you to the behind-the-scene workers Thiney and Kelsey.

This game is made for entertainment purposes only and is not meant to undermine the severity of Covid-19 in any way. 
It promotes the superheroes of 2020: the front-line workers, teachers, medical staff and everyone else who have risked their lives so that others can be safe. 
We are forever grateful.
