/*Intro,middle and ending 
Purello: Hello, how may I help you?
Mario: I'd like to enter Warzone 2020
P: You will have to start at level zero. Be careful, there is a deadly virus around
M: How do I get there?
P: Go through the red door
M: Thank you. I am Mario-Pants. What is your name?
P: Purello Lysol. Good luck Mario-Pants. Be sure to sanitize after touching the door
M: Yes. I will put an end to this deadly virus.
P: Let me know if you need any help

OPTIONAL---After Level 0---
M: I defeated the first level. It was a close call. How do I get to the second level?....I should call Purello.
*calls Purello*
P: Hello? Purello Lysol speaking
M: Its Mario-Pants. I defeated level 0, how do I get to the next level?
P: Warzone 2020 is very magical. Keep walking and you will be taken there- oh no! The virus is here! 
*call ends*
M: Purello? PURELLO?! Oh no! I better hurry and save him. 
-----End----- 

 P: Thank you for saving me. You did it, you beat the virus!
 M: Yes, but my work is far from over. 
 P: You look like you might need some help
 M: Definitely. Let's defeat the virus together on other warzones. Hereâ€™s a vaccine.
 P: *takes it* Onward to the rest of Warzone 2020!
 
 Mario-Pants together with Purello Lysol will defeat the virus and save all of humanity.
